# breeze - chat management plugin for Endstone/Kherimoya
</div>

## introduction
Breeze is a chat management system from [Kheremara](https://github.com/chalupa-muntinlupa/kherimoya#kheremara-projects) meant to work with [Kherimoya](https://github.com/chalupa-muntinlupa/kherimoya) that provides things like **chat filtering** and **extension support** right out of the box, so you can do pretty much anything with it.

Breeze isn't very feature-rich out of the box *(for now)*, but you can make it feature rich using the extension API, which lets you modify and add on to Breeze.

The mean appeal of Breeze right now is its chat filtering.

### *why is it a "chat management" system instead of a "chat filtering" system?*
Because features like tags *(like a prefix berfore one's name, e.g. `[tag] <name> hello`)*, stripping out formatting stuff from messages, and other chat management stuff can *(somewhat)* easily be implemented by the extension system AND are upcoming.
